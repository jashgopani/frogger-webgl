# :frog: Frogger Game using WebGL - Jash Gopani

This project is a WebGL implementation of the classic arcade game Frogger. It was developed by Jash Gopani as part of a computer graphics course. The game aims to recreate the familiar Frogger experience in a modern web environment, leveraging WebGL for rendering and user interaction.

## Features

### P0
- **Setup basic extensible rendering pipeline**: The rendering pipeline has been established to support extensibility for future enhancements.
- **Add indice-based rendering support**: Implemented rendering support using indices for efficient graphics processing.
- **Add perspective**: Introduced perspective to provide depth and realism to the game environment.
- **Add generators for primitives**: Developed generators to create basic geometric primitives required for the game.
- **Use primitive generators for modelling**: Utilized primitive generators to model various elements within the game scene.
- **Prepare static scene complete**: Initial setup of the static game scene is completed, providing the foundation for further development.
- **Add user interaction and apply transformations to moving objects**: Implemented user interaction mechanisms and applied transformations to animate moving objects within the game.
- **Add collision detection and other rules using bounding box**: Incorporated collision detection using bounding boxes to enforce game rules and interactions.
- **Add sound effects**: Implemented sound effects to enhance the gaming experience.

### P1
- **Add textures**: Pending
- **Score calculation**: Implemented logic for score calculation when frog reaches the landing zone and number of lives reduce when frog meets an accident
- **Make your own part**: Pending
